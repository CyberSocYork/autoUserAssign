# autoUserAssign

## What it Does
This script will automatically assign a user to the lowest free user on a server from a single `login` account

## How it Works
The script loops from 0 to 100 and sees if their is a user logged in with that number. 
When the it reaches a number of an account that is not used, the user then ssh into that account locally.
If there are no free user accounts, the user is notified and logged out of the `login` account.

## How to Use It
Simply append the script to the bottom of the `.bashrc` file of the `login` user and ensure that the account has its SSH public key in all the user accounts `authorized_keys` file
